Depends on the complexity of the firmware.
Too complicate -- Heuristic cannot handle the path exploration.


Fail:
1. Interrupt
   - Qemu only supports 16 exceptions and 64 interrupts.
   - Do not know the exact time to rise an interrupt.
2. Short exploration path results in unsound peripheral values, which leads Qemu to a dead loop. Long exploration path results in dead states.
3. Hardware Logics
   - MPU: Memory region permission violation to trigger bus fault
   - CRC: Generate a CRC value for a memory region.
   - RNGA: No random number generated.
   - FlexCan: No transfer through FlexCan.
   - etc.
