=head1 NAME

qemu-ga-ref - QEMU Guest Agent Protocol Reference

=head1 DESCRIPTION


General note concerning the use of guest agent interfaces:

"unsupported" is a higher-level error than the errors that individual
commands might document. The caller should always be prepared to receive
QERR_UNSUPPORTED, even if the given command doesn't specify it, or doesn't
document any failure mode at all.



B<guest-sync-delimited>  (Command)
Echo back a unique integer value, and prepend to response a
leading sentinel byte (0xFF) the client can check scan for.

This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the
wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale
data from previous client. It must be issued upon initial
connection, and after any client-side timeouts (including
timeouts on receiving a response to this command).

After issuing this request, all guest agent responses should be
ignored until the response containing the unique integer value
the client passed in is returned. Receival of the 0xFF sentinel
byte must be handled as an indication that the client's
lexer/tokenizer/parser state should be flushed/reset in
preparation for reliably receiving the subsequent response. As
an optimization, clients may opt to ignore all data until a
sentinel value is receiving to avoid unnecessary processing of
stale data.

Similarly, clients should also precede this I<request>
with a 0xFF byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any
partially read JSON data from a previous client connection.

=over 4


=item C<'id'>

randomly generated 64-bit integer

=back



B<Returns:>
The unique integer id passed in by the client

B<Since:>
1.1






B<guest-sync>  (Command)
Echo back a unique integer value

This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the
wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale
data from previous client. All guest agent responses should be
ignored until the provided unique integer value is returned,
and it is up to the client to handle stale whole or
partially-delivered JSON text in such a way that this response
can be obtained.

In cases where a partial stale response was previously
received by the client, this cannot always be done reliably.
One particular scenario being if qemu-ga responses are fed
character-by-character into a JSON parser. In these situations,
using guest-sync-delimited may be optimal.

For clients that fetch responses line by line and convert them
to JSON objects, guest-sync should be sufficient, but note that
in cases where the channel is dirty some attempts at parsing the
response may result in a parser error.

Such clients should also precede this command
with a 0xFF byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any
partially read JSON data from a previous session.

B<guest-get-time>  (Command)
Get the information about guest's System Time relative to
the Epoch of 1970-01-01 in UTC.


B<Returns:>
Time in nanoseconds.

B<Since:>
1.5






B<guest-set-time>  (Command)
Set guest time.

When a guest is paused or migrated to a file then loaded
from that file, the guest OS has no idea that there
was a big gap in the time. Depending on how long the
gap was, NTP might not be able to resynchronize the
guest.

This command tries to set guest's System Time to the
given value, then sets the Hardware Clock (RTC) to the
current System Time. This will make it easier for a guest
to resynchronize without waiting for NTP. If no C<time> is
specified, then the time to set is read from RTC. However,
this may not be supported on all platforms (i.e. Windows).
If that's the case users are advised to always pass a
value.

=over 4


=item C<'time'> (optional)

=over 4


=item C<'minimum'> (optional)

Minimum contiguous free range to discard, in bytes. Free ranges
smaller than this may be ignored (this is a hint and the guest
may not respect it).  By increasing this value, the fstrim
operation will complete more quickly for filesystems with badly
fragmented free space, although not all blocks will be discarded.

B<guest-suspend-disk>  (Command)
Suspend guest to disk.

This command tries to execute the scripts provided by the pm-utils package.
If it's not available, the suspend operation will be performed by manually
writing to a sysfs file.

For the best results it's strongly recommended to have the pm-utils
package installed in the guest.

This command does NOT return a response on success. There is a high chance
the command succeeded if the VM exits with a zero exit status or, when
running with --no-shutdown, by issuing the query-status QMP command to
to confirm the VM status is "shutdown". However, the VM could also exit
(or set its status to "shutdown") due to other reasons.

The following errors may be returned:
If suspend to disk is not supported, Unsupported


B<Notes:>
It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command before
sending commands when the guest resumes

B<Since:>
1.1






B<guest-suspend-ram>  (Command)
Suspend guest to ram.

This command tries to execute the scripts provided by the pm-utils package.
If it's not available, the suspend operation will be performed by manually
writing to a sysfs file.

For the best results it's strongly recommended to have the pm-utils
package installed in the guest.

IMPORTANT: guest-suspend-ram requires QEMU to support the 'system_wakeup'
command.  Thus, it's I<required> to query QEMU for the presence of the
'system_wakeup' command before issuing guest-suspend-ram.

This command does NOT return a response on success. There are two options
to check for success:

=over 4


=item 1.

Wait for the SUSPEND QMP event from QEMU

=item 2.

Issue the query-status QMP command to confirm the VM status is
"suspended"


=back


The following errors may be returned:
If suspend to ram is not supported, Unsupported


B<Notes:>
It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command before
sending commands when the guest resumes

B<Since:>
1.1






B<guest-suspend-hybrid>  (Command)
Save guest state to disk and suspend to ram.

This command requires the pm-utils package to be installed in the guest.

IMPORTANT: guest-suspend-hybrid requires QEMU to support the 'system_wakeup'
command.  Thus, it's I<required> to query QEMU for the presence of the
'system_wakeup' command before issuing guest-suspend-hybrid.

This command does NOT return a response on success. There are two options
to check for success:

=over 4


=item 1.

Wait for the SUSPEND QMP event from QEMU

=item 2.

Issue the query-status QMP command to confirm the VM status is

Whether the VCPU is enabled.

=item C<'can-offline'> (optional)

 Whether offlining the VCPU is possible. This member
is always filled in by the guest agent when the structure is

then).

B<guest-get-vcpus>  (Command)
Retrieve the list of the guest's logical processors.

This is a read-only operation.


B<Returns:>

list exactly once, but their order is unspecified.

B<Since:>
1.5






B<guest-set-vcpus>  (Command)
Attempt to reconfigure (currently: enable/disable) logical processors inside
the guest.

The input list is processed node by node in order. In each node C<logical-id>
is used to look up the guest VCPU, for which C<online> specifies the requested
state. The set of distinct C<logical-id>'s is only required to be a subset of
the guest-supported identifiers. There's no restriction on list length or on
repeating the same C<logical-id> (with possibly different C<online> field).
Preferably the input list should describe a modified subset of
C<guest-get-vcpus>' return value.


B<Returns:>
The length of the initial sublist that has been successfully
processed. The guest agent maximizes this value. Possible cases:


=over 4


=item -

0:              if the C<vcpus> list was empty on input. Guest state
has not been changed. Otherwise,

=item -

Error:          processing the first node of C<vcpus> failed for the
reason returned. Guest state has not been changed.
Otherwise,

=item -

E<lt> length(C<vcpus>): more than zero initial nodes have been processed,
but not the entire C<vcpus> list. Guest state has
changed accordingly. To retrieve the error
(assuming it persists), repeat the call with the
successfully processed initial sublist removed.
Otherwise,

=item -

length(C<vcpus>): call successful.

=item C<'crypted'>

to ensure the correct crypt() encryption scheme is used. This
command does not attempt to interpret or report on the encryption
scheme. Refer to the documentation of the guest operating system
in question to determine what is supported.

Not all guest operating systems will support use of the
C<crypted> flag, as they may require the clear-text password

The C<password> parameter must always be base64 encoded before
transmission, even if already crypt()d, to ensure it is 8-bit
safe when passed as JSON.
